Regressions
===========

* `S3#open` has switched from `Down.download` to `Down.open` in the previous
  Shrine version, however the Down version 2.3.3 doesn't require `net/http`,
  which means that `S3#open` would raise an "undefined constant Net" error
  in case `net/http` wasn't required anywhere else. This is fixed by bumping
  the required Down version to 2.3.4, which requires net/http.
