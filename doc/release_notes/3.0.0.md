title: Shrine 3.0.0
---

This guide covers all the changes in the 3.0.0 version of Shrine. If you're
currently using Shrine 2.x, see **[Upgrading to Shrine 3.x]** for instructions
on how to upgrade.

## Major features

### Derivatives

The new **[`derivatives`][derivatives]** plugin has been added for storing
additional processed files alongside the main file.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :derivatives
```
```rb
class ImageUploader < Shrine
  Attacher.derivatives_processor do |original|
    magick = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original) 

    {
      large:  magick.resize_to_limit!(800, 800),
      medium: magick.resize_to_limit!(500, 500),
      small:  magick.resize_to_limit!(300, 300),
    }
  end
end
```
```rb
photo = Photo.new(photo_params)
photo.image_derivatives! # creates derivatives
photo.save
```

This is a rewrite of the [`versions`][versions] plugin, bringing numerous
improvements:

* processed files are separated from the main file

  ```rb
  photo.image_data #=>
  # {
  #   "id": "original.jpg",
  #   "storage": "store",
  #   "metadata": { ... },
  #   "derivatives": {
  #     "large": { "id": "large.jpg", "storage": "store", "metadata": { ... } },
  #     "medium": { "id": "medium.jpg", "storage": "store", "metadata": { ... } },
  #     "small": { "id": "small.jpg", "storage": "store", "metadata": { ... } }
  #   }
  # }

  photo.image             #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="original.jpg" ...>
  photo.image_derivatives #=>
  # {
  #   large: #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="large.jpg" ...>,
  #   medium: #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="medium.jpg" ...>,
  #   small: #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="small.jpg" ...>,
  # }
  ```

* processing is decoupled from promotion

  ```rb
  photo = Photo.create(image: file) # promote original file to permanent storage
  photo.image_derivatives!          # generate derivatives after promotion
  photo.save                        # save derivatives data
  ```

- ability to add or remove processed files at any point

  ```rb
  class ImageUploader < Shrine
    Attacher.derivatives_processor :thumbnails do |original|
      # ...
    end

    Attacher.derivatives_processor :crop do |original, left:, top:, width:, height:|
      vips = ImageProcessing::Vips.source(original)

      { cropped: vips.crop!(left, top, width, height) }
    end
  end
  ```
  ```rb
  photo.image_derivatives!(:thumbnails)
  photo.image_derivatives #=> { large: ..., medium: ..., small: ... }
  photo.save

  # ... sometime later ...

  photo.image_derivatives!(:crop, left: 0, top: 0, width: 300, height: 300)
  photo.image_derivatives #=> { large: ..., medium: ..., small: ..., cropped: ... }
  photo.save
  ```

* possibility of uploading processed files to different storage

  ```rb
  class ImageUploader < Shrine
    # specify storage for all derivatives
    Attacher.derivatives_storage :other_store

    # or specify storage per derivative
    Attacher.derivatives_storage { |derivative| :other_store }
  end
  ```
  ```rb
  photo = Photo.create(image: file)
  photo.image.storage_key #=> :store

  photo.image_derivatives!
  photo.image_derivatives[:large].storage_key #=> :other_store
  ```

### Attacher redesign

The [`Shrine::Attacher`][attacher] class has been rewritten and can now be
used without models:

```rb
attacher = Shrine::Attacher.new
attacher.attach(file)
attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
```

The `Attacher#data`, `Attacher#load_data`, and `Attacher.from_data` methods
have been added for dumping and loading the attached file:

```rb
# dump attached file into a serializable Hash
data = attacher.data #=> { "id" => "abc123.jpg", "storage" => "store", "metadata" => { ... } }
```
```rb
# initialize attacher from attached file data...
attacher = Shrine::Attacher.from_data(data)
attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="abc123.jpg" storage=:store metadata={...}>

# ...or load attached file into an existing attacher
attacher = Shrine::Attacher.new
attacher.load_data(data)
attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
```

Several more methods have been added:

- `Attacher#attach` – attaches the file directly to permanent storage
- `Attacher#attach_cached` – extracted from `Attacher#assign`
- `Attacher#upload` – calls `Shrine#upload`, passing `:record` and `:name` context
- `Attacher#file` – alias for `Attacher#get`
- `Attacher#cache_key` – returns temporary storage key (`:cache` by default)
- `Attacher#store_key` – returns permanent storage key (`:store` by default)

#### Column

The new [`column`][column] plugin adds the ability to serialize attached file
data, in format suitable for writing into a database column.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :column
```
```rb
# dump attached file data into a JSON string
data = attacher.column_data #=> '{"id":"abc123.jpg","storage":"store","metadata":{...}}'
```
```rb
# initialize attacher from attached file data...
attacher = Shrine::Attacher.from_column(data)
attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="abc123.jpg" storage=:store metadata={...}>

# ...or load attached file into an existing attacher
attacher = Shrine::Attacher.new
attacher.load_column(data)
attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
```

#### Entity

The new [`entity`][entity] plugin adds support for immutable structs, which
are commonly used with ROM, Hanami and dry-rb.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :entity
```
```rb
class Photo < Hanami::Entity
  include Shrine::Attachment(:image)
end
```
```rb
photo = Photo.new(image_data: '{"id":"abc123.jpg","storage":"store","metadata":{...}}')
photo.image #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="abc123.jpg" storage=:store ...>
```

#### Model

The new [`model`][model] plugin adds support for mutable structs, which is
used by `activerecord` and `sequel` plugins.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :model
```
```rb
class Photo < Struct.new(:image_data)
  include Shrine::Attachment(:image)
end
```
```rb
photo = Photo.new
photo.image = file
photo.image #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="abc123.jpg" storage=:cache ...>
photo.image_data #=> #=> '{"id":"abc123.jpg", "storage":"cache", "metadata":{...}}'
```

### Backgrounding rewrite

* The [`backgrounding`][backgrounding] plugin has been rewritten for more
flexibility and simplicity. The new usage is much more explicit:

```rb
Shrine.plugin :backgrounding
Shrine::Attacher.promote_block do
  PromoteJob.perform_async(self.class.name, record.class.name, record.id, name, file_data)
end
Shrine::Attacher.destroy_block do
  DestroyJob.perform_async(self.class.name, data)
end
```
```rb
class PromoteJob
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(attacher_class, record_class, record.id, name, file_data)
    attacher_class = Object.const_get(attacher_class)
    record         = Object.const_get(record_class).find(record_id) # if using Active Record

    attacher = attacher_class.retrieve(model: record, name: name, file: file_data)
    attacher.atomic_promote
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged, ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    # attachment has changed or the record has been deleted, nothing to do
  end
end
```
```rb
class DestroyJob
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(attacher_class, data)
    attacher_class = Object.const_get(attacher_class)

    attacher = attacher_class.from_data(data)
    attacher.destroy
  end
end
```

There are several main differences compared to the old implementation:

- we are in charge of passing the record to the background job
- we can access the attacher before promotion
- we can react to errors that caused promotion to abort

We can now also register backgrounding hooks on an attacher instance, allowing
us to pass additional parameters to the background job:

```rb
photo = Photo.new(photo_params)

photo.image_attacher.promote_block do |attacher|
  PromoteJob.perform_async(
    attacher.class.name,
    attacher.record.class.name,
    attacher.record.id,
    attacher.name,
    attacher.file_data,
    current_user.id, # <== parameters from the controller
  )
end

photo.save # will call our instance-level backgrounding hook
```

### Persistence interface

The persistence plugins (`activerecord`, `sequel`) now implement a unified
[persistence] interface:

| Method                    | Description                                           |
| :-----------------        | :----------                                           |
| `Attacher#persist`        | persists attachment data                              |
| `Attacher#atomic_persist` | persists attachment data if attachment hasn’t changed |
| `Attacher#atomic_promote` | promotes cached file and atomically persists changes  |

The "atomic" methods use the new [`atomic_helpers`][atomic_helpers] plugin,
and are useful for background jobs. For example, this is how we'd use them to
implement metadata extraction in the background in a concurrency-safe way:

```rb
MetadataJob.perform_async(
  attacher.class.name,
  attacher.record.class.name,
  attacher.record.id,
  attacher.name,
  attacher.file_data,
)
```
```rb
class MetadataJob
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(attacher_class, record_class, record_id, name, file_data)
    attacher_class = Object.const_get(attacher_class)
    record         = Object.const_get(record_class).find(record_id) # if using Active Record

    attacher = attacher_class.retrieve(model: record, name: name, file: file_data)
    attacher.refresh_metadata! # extract metadata
    attacher.atomic_persist    # persist if attachment hasn't changed
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged, ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    # attachment has changed or record has been deleted, nothing to do
  end
end
```

## Other new plugins

* The new [`mirroring`][mirroring] plugin has been added for replicating
  uploads and deletes to other storages.

  ```rb
  Shrine.storages = { cache: ..., store: ..., backup: ... }

  Shrine.plugin :mirroring, mirror: { store: :backup }
  ```
  ```rb
  file = Shrine.upload(io, :store) # uploads to :store and :backup
  file.delete                      # deletes from :store and :backup
  ```

* The new [`multi_cache`][multi_cache] plugin has been added for allowing an
  attacher to accept files from additional temporary storages.

  ```rb
  Shrine.storages = { cache: ..., cache_one: ..., cache_two: ..., store: ... }

  Shrine.plugin :multi_cache, additional_cache: [:cache_one, :cache_two]
  ```
  ```rb
  photo.image = { "id" => "...", "storage" => "cache", "metadata" => { ... } }
  photo.image.storage_key #=> :cache
  # or
  photo.image = { "id" => "...", "storage" => "cache_one", "metadata" => { ... } }
  photo.image.storage_key #=> :cache_one
  # or
  photo.image = { "id" => "...", "storage" => "cache_two", "metadata" => { ... } }
  photo.image.storage_key #=> :cache_two
  ```

* The new [`form_assign`][form_assign] plugin has been added for assigning
  files directly from form params.

  ```rb
  Shrine.plugin :form_assign
  ```
  ```rb
  attacher = photo.image_attacher
  attacher.form_assign("image" => file, "title" => "...", "description" => "...")
  attacher.file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile id="..." storage=:cache ...>
  ```

## Other features

* Model file assignment can now be configured to upload directly to permanent
  storage.

  ```rb
  Shrine.plugin :model, cache: false
  ```
  ```rb
  photo.image = file
  photo.image.storage_key #=> :store (permanent storage)
  ```

* New `Shrine.download_response` method has been added to the
  `download_endpoint` plugin for generating file response from the controller.

  ```rb
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    get "/attachments" => "files#download"
  end
  ```
  ```rb
  class FilesController < ApplicationController
    def download
      # ... we can now perform things like authentication here ...
      set_rack_response Shrine.download_response(env)
    end

    private

    def set_rack_response((status, headers, body))
      self.status = status
      self.headers.merge!(headers)
      self.response_body = body
    end
  end
  ```

* The `Attacher#refresh_metadata!` method has been added to `refresh_metadata`
  plugin. It refreshes metadata and writes new attached file data back into the
  data attribute.

  ```rb
  attacher.file.refresh_metadata!
  attacher.write
  # can now be shortened to
  attacher.refresh_metadata!
  ```

* Including a `Shrine::Attachment` module now defines a `.<name>_attacher`
  class method on the target class.

  ```rb
  class Photo
    include ImageUploader::Attachment(:image)
  end
  ```
  ```rb
  Photo.image_attacher #=> #<ImageUploader::Attacher ...>
  ```

* The attachment data serializer is now configurable (by default `JSON`
  standard library is used):

  ```rb
  require "oj" # https://github.com/ohler55/oj

  Shrine.plugin :column, serializer: Oj
  ```

* It's now possible to pass options to the validate block via the `:validate`
  option:

  ```rb
  attacher.assign(file, validate: { foo: "bar" })
  ```
  ```rb
  class MyUploader < Shrine
    Attacher.validate do |**options|
      options #=> { foo: "bar" }
    end
  end
  ```

* Validation can now be skipped on assignment by passing `validate: false`.

  ```rb
  attacher.attach(file, validate: false) # skip validation
  ```

* Closing the uploaded file can now be prevented by passing `close: false` to
  `Shrine#upload`.

* Uploaded file can now be automatically deleted by passing `delete: true` to
  `Shrine#upload`.

* New `Attacher#file!` method has been added for retrieving the attached file
  and raising and exception if it doesn't exist.

* New `Derivation#opened` method has been added for retrieving an opened
  derivative in `derivation_endpoint` plugin.

* New `Storage#delete_prefixed` method has been added for deleting all files
  in specified directory.

  ```rb
  storage.delete_prefixed("some_directory/")
  ```

## Performance improvements

* The attached file is now parsed and loaded from record column only once,
  which can greatly improve performance if the same attached file is being
  accessed multiple times.

  ```rb
  photo = Photo.find(photo_id)
  photo.image # parses and loads attached file
  photo.image # returns memoized attached file
  ```

* The `S3#open` method doesn't perform a `#head_obect` request anymore.

* The `derivation_endpoint` plugin doesn't perform a `Storage#exists?` call
  anymore when `:upload` is enabled.

* The `download_endpoint` plugin doesn't perform a `Storage#exists?` call
  anymore.

## Other Improvements

### Core improvements

* Shrine now works again with MRI 2.3.

* The memory storage from the [shrine-memory] gem has been merged into core.

  ```rb
  # Gemfile
  gem "shrine-memory" # this can be removed
  ```

* The `Attacher#assign` method now accepts cached file data as a Hash.

  ```rb
  photo.image = { "id" => "...", "storage" => "cache", "metadata" => { ... } }
  ````

* An `UploadedFile` object can now be initialized with symbol keys.

  ```rb
  Shrine.uploaded_file(id: "...", storage: :store, metadata: { ... })
  ```

* The temporary storage doesn't need to be defined anymore if it's not used.

* Any changes to `Shrine.storages` will now be applied to existing `Shrine` and
  `Attacher` instances.

* When copying the S3 object to another location, any specified upload options
  will now be applied.

* Deprecation of passing unknown options to `FileSystem#open` has been
  reverted. This allows users to continue using `FileSystem` storage in tests
  as a mock storage.

* The `Shrine#upload` method now infers file extension from `filename` metadata,
  making possible to use `filename` to specify file extension.

  ```rb
  file = uploader.upload(StringIO.new("some text"), metadata: { "filename" => "file.txt" })
  file.id #=> "2a2467ee6acbc5cb.txt"
  ```

* The `Shrine.opts` hash is now deep-copied on subclassing. This allows plugins
  to freely mutate hashes and arrays in `Shrine.opts`, knowing they won't be
  shared across subclasses.

* The `down` dependency has been updated to `~> 5.0`.

* The `Shrine::Attachment[]` method has been added as an alternative syntax for
  creating attachment modules.

  ```rb
  class Photo
    include ImageUploader::Attachment[:image]
  end
  ```

### Plugin improvements

* The `activerecord` plugin now works with Active Record 3.

* Callback code from `activerecord` and `sequel` plugin has been moved into
  attacher methods, allowing the user to override them.

  - `Attacher#(activerecord|sequel)_before_save`
  - `Attacher#(activerecord|sequel)_after_save`
  - `Attacher#(activerecord|sequel)_after_destroy`

* The `url_options` plugin now allows you to override URL options by deleting
  them.

  ```rb
  uploaded_file.url(response_content_disposition: "attachment")
  ```
  ```rb
  plugin :url_options, store: -> (io, options) {
    disposition = options.delete(:response_content_disposition, "inline")

    {
      response_content_disposition: ContentDisposition.format(
        disposition: disposition,
        filename:    io.original_filename,
      )
    }
  }
  ```

* The `:upload_options` hash passed to the uploader is now merged with any
  options defined with the `upload_options` plugin.

* The `default_storage` now evaluates the storage block in context of the
  `Attacher` instance.

* New `Attacher.default_cache` and `Attacher.default_store` methods have been
  added to the `default_storage` plugin for declaratively setting default
  storage.

  ```rb
  Attacher.default_cache { ... }
  Attacher.default_store { ... }
  ```

* The `derivation_endpoint` plugin now handles string derivation names.

* The `Derivation#upload` method from `derivation_endpoint` plugin now accepts
  additional uploader options

* The `Derivation#upload` method from `derivation_endpoint` plugin now accepts
  any IO-like object.

* The `derivation_endpoint` plugin doesn't re-open `File` objects returned in
  derivation block anymore.

* The `instrumentation` plugin now instruments `UploadedFile#open` calls as a
  new `open.shrine` event. `UploadedFile#download` is still instrumented as
  `download.shrine`.

* The `upload.shrine` event now has `:metadata` on the top level in
  `instrumentation` plugin.

* The width & height validators in `store_dimensions` plugin don't require
  `UploadedFile#width` and `UploadedFile#height` methods to be defined anymore,
  only that the corresponding metadata exists.

* Any options passed to `Attacher#attach_cached` are now forwarded to metadata
  extraction when `restore_cached_data` plugin is loaded.

* The `infer_extension` plugin now works correctly with `pretty_location`
  plugin when `pretty_location` was loaded after `infer_extension`.

* The `pretty_location` plugin now accepts `:class_underscore` option for
  underscoring class names.

  ```rb
  plugin :pretty_location
  # "blogpost/aa357797-5845-451b-8662-08eecdc9f762/image/493g82jf23.jpg"

  plugin :pretty_location, class_underscore: :true
  # "blog_post/aa357797-5845-451b-8662-08eecdc9f762/image/493g82jf23.jpg"
  ```

* You can now load multiple persistence plugins simulatenously, and the correct
  one will be activated during persistence.

## Backwards compatibility

### Plugin deprecation and removal

* The `backgrounding` plugin has been rewritten and has a new API. While the
  new API works in a similar way, no backwards compatibility has been kept with
  the previous API.

* The `versions`, `processing`, `recache`, and `delete_raw` plugins have been
  deprecated in favor of the new `derivatives` plugin.

* The `module_include` plugin has been deprecated over overriding core classes
  directly.

* The `hooks`, `parallelize`, `parsed_json`, and `delete_promoted` plugins have
  been removed.

* The deprecated `copy`, `backup`, `multi_delete`, `moving`, `logging`,
  `direct_upload` `background_helpers`, and `migration_helpers` plugins have
  been removed.

* The `default_url_options` plugin has been renamed to `url_options`.

### Attacher API

* The `Attacher.new` method now only accepts a hash of options, use
  `Attacher.from_model` for initializing from a model.

* If you're changing the attachment data column directly, you'll now need to
  call `Attacher#reload` to make the attacher reflect those changes.

* The `Attacher#promote` method now only saves the promoted file in memory,
  it doesn't persist the changes.

* The `Attacher#_set` and `Attacher#set` methods have been renamed to
  `Attacher#set` and `Attacher#changed`.

* The `Attacher#cache!`, `Attacher#store!`, and `Attacher#delete!` methods have
  been removed.

* The `Attacher#_promote` and `Attacher#_delete` methods have been removed.

* The `Attacher#swap`, `Attacher#update`, `Attacher#read`, `Attacher#write`,
  `Attacher#convert_to_data`, `Attacher#convert_before_write`, and
  `Attache#convert_after_read` methods have been removed.

* The `Attacher.validate`, `Attacher#validate` and `Attacher#errors` methods
  have been extracted into the new `validation` plugin.

* The `Attacher#data_attribute` method has been renamed to `Attacher#attribute`.

* The `Attacher#replace` method has been renamed to
  `Attacher#destroy_previous`.

* The `Attacher#assign` method now raises an exception when non-cached uploaded
  file is assigned.

* The `Attacher#attached?` method now returns whether a file is attached,
  regardless of whether it was changed or not.

### Attachment API

* The `Shrine::Attachment` module doesn't define any instance methods by itself
  anymore. This has been moved into `entity` and `model` plugins.

### Uploader API

* The `:phase` option has been removed.

* The `Shrine#process` and `Shrine#processed` methods have been removed.

* The `Shrine#store`, `Shrine#_store`, `Shrine#put`, and `Shrine#copy` methods
  have been removed.

* The `Shrine#delete`, `Shrine#_delete`, and `Shrine#remove` methods have been
  removed.

* The `Shrine#uploaded?` method has been removed.

* The `Shrine.uploaded_file` method doesn't yield files anymore by default.

* The options for `Shrine#upload` and `Shrine#extract_metadata` are now
  required to have symbol keys.

* The `Shrine.uploaded_file` method now raises `ArgumentError` on invalid
  arguments.

* The `Shrine#upload` method doesn't rescue exceptions that happen in
  `IO#close` anymore.

* The deprecated `Shrine::IO_METHODS` constant has been removed.

### Uploaded File API

* The `UploadedFile` method now extracts data from the given hash on
  initialization, it doesn't store the whole hash anymore. This means the
  following potential code won't work anymore:

  ```rb
  uploaded_file.id #=> "foo"
  uploaded_file.data["id"] = "bar"
  uploaded_file.id #=> "foo"
  ```

* The `UploadedFile#storage_key` method now returns a Symbol instead of a
  String.

  ```rb
  # previous behaviour
  uploaded_file.storage_key #=> "store"

  # new behaviour
  uploaded_file.storage_key #=> :store
  ```

* The `UploadedFile#==` method now requires both uploaded file objects to be
  of the same class.

### Storage API

* The `Storage#open` method is now required to accept additional options.

  ```rb
  # this won't work anymore
  def open(id)
    # ...
  end

  # this is now required
  def open(id, **options)
    # ...
  end
  ```

* The `Storage#open` method is now required to raise `Shrine::FileNotFound`
  exception when the file is missing.

### S3 API

* The support for `aws-sdk` 2.x and `aws-sdk-s3` < 1.14 has been removed.

* `S3#open` now raises `Shrine::FileNotFound` exception when S3 object doesn't
  exist on the bucket.

* The `S3#upload` method will now override any S3 object data when copying
  from another S3 object. If you were relying on S3 object data being inherited
  on copy, you will need to update your code.

* The `:host` option in `S3#initialize` has been removed.

* The `:download` option in `S3#url` has been removed.

* Specifying `:multipart_threshold` as an integer is not supported anymore.

* Non URI-escaped `:content_disposition` and `:response_content_disposition`
  values are not supported anymore.

* The `S3#presign` method now returns a hash instead of an object for default
  POST method.

* The deprecated `S3#stream`, `S3#download`, and `S3#s3` methods have been
  removed.

* The `S3#open` method doesn't include an `:object` in `Down::ChunkedIO#data`
  anymore.

### FileSystem API

* `FileSystem#open` now raises `Shrine::FileNotFound` exception when file does
  not exist on the filesystem.

* The deprecated `:host` option in `FileSystem#initialize` has been removed.

* The deprecated `:older_than` option in `FileSystem#clear!` has been removed.

* The deprecated `FileSystem#download` method has been removed.

* The `FileSystem#movable?` and `FileSystem#move` methods have been made
  private.

* The `FileSystem#open` method doesn't accept a block anymore.

### Plugins API

* `remote_url`

  - A custom downloader is now required to raise
