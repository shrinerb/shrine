## Regressions

* Prior to version 2.4.0, the conversion of uploaded file data to JSON was
  happening in `Attacher#_set`, and `Attacher#write` simply assigned the value
  that it received to the data attribute of the model instance. During
  refactoring for 2.4.0, the JSON conversion was accidentally moved to
  `Attacher#write`, which affects anyone who was using `Attacher#write`
  directly and passing it a JSON string, by resulting in a double-encoded
  string being assigned to the data attribute. This has now been reverted.

## Improvements

* The `remove_invalid` plugin will now assign back a previous attachment if it
  was there, in case the assigned cached file was invalid. Before `nil` was
  always assigned. This enables you to display the previous attachment to the
  user in case of file validation errors.

* `UploadedFile#download` will now create the Tempfile using
  `UploadedFile#extension`, which handles the case when `#id` doesn't have
  extension, but `#original_filename` has (which could be the behaviour of
  some custom storages)

## Backwards compatibility

* The `FileSystem#download` method has been deprecated, and will be removed in
  Shrine 3. The replacement is to simply use `UploadedFile#download`, which will
  use `FileSystem#open` to create a Tempfile in the same way
  `FileSystem#download` did previously. This shouldn't affect you unless you
  were using `FileSystem#download` directly.
